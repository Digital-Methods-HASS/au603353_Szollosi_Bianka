Steps for executing the code:
clone this repo
open your terminal
change directory to the src folder
then execute the code with the following commands:
  -for the first script execute:
    python lr-mnist.py
  -for the second script execute either:
    -python nn-mnist.py (script uses the whole dataset, might take a really long time to run)
    -python nn-mnist_subset.py (script uses only a subset of the data, runs relatively fast)
